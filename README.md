# Shop-list-app

### `npm install` 
### `npm start`

This is my first React app written classes.
![shopping-list](https://github.com/Egor-Ivankov/Shop-list-app/blob/main/src/scrinshots/shopping-list.png)

This application implements the search inside the shopping list, shopping filters, adding new purchases without reloading the page.

I think that you can find something useful for yourself in this application!
